# Random Float Generator

## Description

This program is designed to print randomly generated floating point numbers using a user input to determine how many. It will put these numbers into an array and print them out to the console in hexadecimal and scientific decimal form. It will then sort the array and print them again. Finally, it will normalize the arrays into number between 1 and 2 and print the array.

This project is mostly written in x86-64 assembly. It uses a quicksort algorithm written in C++ and it uses a driver module written in C.

Random Float Generator was created as an assignment for the course CPSC 240-7, conducted by Floyd Holliday at CSUF.
